# Spreading-Correction

Supplementary information to the submitted manuscript  "Computational correction of cross-contamination due to exclusion amplification barcode spreading" by Anton JM Larsson, Geoff	Stanley, Rahul	Sinha, Irving	L.	Weissman,	Rickard	Sandberg

The Jupyter notebook (Correcting_Spreading_of_Signal_Notebook.ipynb) contains Python code for the analysis and correction of index-swapping, including the generation of Figures 1 and 2 in the manuscript. In a separate notebook (soon to be posted) we will provide the R code for the analysis of Figures 3 and 4.
